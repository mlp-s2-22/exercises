	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<p>Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem. In the case of classification, what are the number of classes? Finally, provide the values of \(N\) and \(D\).</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously launched. For each product, we recorded if it was a success or failure, the price charged for the product, the marketing budget, the competition price, and ten other variables.</p>
	<div id="hidden_div1" style="display: none;">
		<details style="margin-left: 90px;">
		  <summary>Solution</summary>
		  <p>This is a classification problem, where the output \(y\) denotes if the product will be a success or failure and the input \(x\) collects information on the price charged for the product, the marketing budget, the competition price, and ten other variables. In this case, we have \(C = 2, N = 20,\) and \(D = 13\).</p>
		</details>
	</div>

	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(b) We are interested in predicting the percentage change in the GBP/EUR exchange rate in relation to weekly changes in world stock markets. We collect weekly data for all of 2018, and for each week, we record the percentage change in the GBP/EUR exchange rate, the percentage change in the UK market, the percentage change in the German market, the percentage change in the US market, and the percentage change in the Chinese market.</p>
	<div id="hidden_div2" style="display: none;">
		<details style="margin-left: 90px;">
		  <summary>Solution</summary>
		  <p>This is a regression problem, where the output \(y\) denotes the percentage change in the GBP/EUR exchange rate and the input \(x\) collects information on the the percentage change in the UK market, the percentage change in the German market, the percentage change in the US market, and the percentage change in the Chinese market. In this case, we have \(N = 52\) and \(D = 4\).</p>
		</details>
	</div>

	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(c) We are interested in identifying species of birds based on audio recordings. We have ten-second audio recordings of 645 birds, and 35 features have been extracted to represent the signals in the raw audio recordings. There are 19 bird species in the dataset.</p>
	<div id="hidden_div3" style="display: none;">
		<details style="margin-left: 90px;">
			<summary>Solution</summary>
			<p>
		  	This is a classifiation problem, where the output \(y\) denotes the bird species and the input \(x\) contains the features that have been extracted to represent the signals in the raw audio recordings. In this case, we have \(C = 19, N = 645,\) and \(D = 35\).
		  	<br><br>
		  	<strong>Note:</strong> In 2013 Kaggle ran a competition on predicting bird species given audio recordings. More details and data can be found here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlsp-2013-birds">https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlsp-2013-birds</a>.

	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(d) An e-commerce company sells fresh produce online. Currently, every product must be manually inspected to determine if it is rotten before being sent to the customer. To save resources, the company is interested in automating this process. They have collected 2,000 images of strawberries of size \(50 \times 50\) and have manually determined whether each strawberry is rotten.</p>
	<div id="hidden_div4" style="display: none;">
		<details style="margin-left: 90px;">
			<summary>Solution</summary>
			<p>
		  	This is a classification problem, where the output \(y\) denotes whether the strawberry is rotten and the input \(x\) is the image of the strawberry. In
	this case, we have \(C = 2, N = 2000,\) and \(D = 50^2\).
		  	<br><br>
		  	<strong>Note:</strong> Amazon purchased Whole Foods in 2017. And since the purchase, Amazon has been developing algorithms and exploring different inputs (e.g. different types of images) to automate the process of manually checking for rotten foods.
